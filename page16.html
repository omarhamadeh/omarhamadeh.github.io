                <blockquote><strong>Never would I, in a million years, would have thought that trick-or-treating this year would be a political jol. I mean, yes, Halloween is my favorite holiday of the year; my obsession with dressing up and performance justifies that. But this year, Halloween for me was my favorite holiday, not just of the year, but of my life. “Damn, what party have you been to Venus? DM us the address! NOW!”, you may exclaim, but honestly, the best party I have ever attended, is the one that’s been happening on streets –here in Lebanon. The one that includes you rioting in front of the police for 25 days, dodging rubber bullets and tear-gas bombs. Are you kidding? So much fun! (I’m not even like, being sarcastic.)
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>But seriously, this is what my country has been going through for the past month, for many, many reasons. Yes, a revolution. No, not a demonstration. Feminists kicking armed-politician bodyguards, 2.5 million flags waving, 16 main highways road-blocked, ISF attacking civilians that were peacefully protesting for their fundamental right to survive economically, thousands of queers march against systematic corruption and patriarchy, road raves, hundreds of booths giving out delicious homemade food for protestors for free and a unifying spirit for all Lebanese citizens across all political parties and sects. Truly, a shocking experience. This time however, without costumes. Everyone is just unapologetically being themselves. Women and men of all ages. All nationalities. And by being themselves, I mean revolting against any politician or security force that annihilates them from their rights to expression, equality and democracy. Heck, people abroad were even booking tickets to experience “our version” of a revolution for some kind of white-washed tourism or something.
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>On Monday, the 4th of November, I had unprecedentedly taken part of a protest that was organized by Dammeh, a feminist and queer organization in Beirut, that marched across the entire city center. The march that consisted of 500 furious protestors, conveyed remarkable chants on a megaphone that struck the corners of every block we came across in Beirut. These chants were very specific in nature, as they intentionally attempted to address the fetishization of certain chauvinistic phrases used by many of the protestors across the country that marginalized and/or dehumanized certain minority groups, especially the LGBTQI+ community, and women.
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>I have been with close friends, family and newly-met wonders, to purge, rave, and demand our rights on those streets, for 20 consecutive days, fighting recklessly. It has really been quite the cathartic journey. I believe it has alluded me to the fact that it would be inevitable to not reduce the spirit of this revolution into the limits of language.The only way to avoid its reductionism is to experience it in person. I have lived in Beirut for 16 years, and to say that this has been the most memorable event of my life, is simply not expressive enough. I wish upon everybody to experience marching, protesting, screaming, raving, eating, crying, thinking, and listening with the people of this country. It is an extremely ethereal and inclusive experience that transforms you in so many ways. Here, people celebrate their pain. And this form of catharsis is one of, if not the most, beautiful things I’ve seen in a culture.
