                <blockquote><p><strong>Author &amp; Video Director: Omar Hamadeh</strong></p><p><strong>Prologue&nbsp;</strong><br></p></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Iconic political figures such as Edward Said and Nawal Al-Saadawi have managed to propel an outlook on the Western perception of Middle Eastern values; that of which essentially being Orientalist and Hetero-patriarchal. However, countries like Lebanon have managed to further perpetuate a politically charged, and provocative agenda against its fundamental functionalist norms, having its communal youth revolute against conservatism. There exists, in Beirut, a blooming, fresh and enlightening Drag scene that has taken Western media outlets like VOGUE, Washington Post, BBC, Annahar, and the Guardian by storm. But these articles, written from a Eurocentric lens, view the growth of our local Drag scene as an exported influence from the famous Western television reality show “Rupaul’s Drag Race” – essentially bringing forefront an orientalist angle as a representation of our community, instead of a genuine and correct display of arab queerness, allocating the narrative to its original angle.
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>LGBTQI+ in Lebanon
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>The Lebanese LGBTQI+ scene has flourished from a long history of repressed queer rage induced by the heteronormative status-quo that constitutes the region. The attempts at Beirut’s queer scene at advocating freedom of speech/expression, is restless. Despite the psychological and physical perils that flamboyant members of the community get exposed to on the daily in a very toxically-masculine environment, (let alone the everlasting trauma triggers, PTSD diagnoses, and clinical depression as a result of internalized self-hatred, bullying, marginalization, harassment and queer-phobia) the community still lingers through. Just 2 years ago, the first middle eastern pride was organized in Beirut by organizer Hadi Damien. Resisting a lockdown last year by the internal security forces for “Beirut Pride 2018”, the community has continued to host events within its own spaces. Until today, performers and queer-friendly events are slowly penetrating into the internationally acclaimed and renounced nightlife scene of the city. Just recently, the famous “Love Night” event hosted by one of the country’s biggest nightclubs “AHM”, featured in an Instagram campaign local drag queens like “Andrea” and “Luxe”, as well as some Lebanese queer activists all choreographically getting together on the dancefloor in a symbol of unison. The indisputable rage that inhabits young Lebanese queers today is the driving force to a historically imminent revolution that will serve a great purpose to eradicate homophobic, transphobic, femme-phobic values and behavioral schemes that uphold most of the region. 
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Lebanese Drag: Scene, Culture &amp; Influence
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Historically, and politically, we have always been depicted, through an orientalist lens as holding conservative values and opinions on some of many notions like transhumanism, intersectional feminism, and identity politics. Even though most of these convictions and claims are inherently stereotypical, Eurocentric/Americanized and false most of the time, some points do apply to conservative regions around Beirut. Just like every other city, the vast intersectionality of several sub-cultures and the widespread of neo-millennial digitalized ethics, has impacted the outreach of many minority groups, especially the members of the LGBTQI+ community. In Lebanon, the LGBTQI+ scene occupies the capital most prominently, with most of its performers being from the same sociological circle of mutual friends. On another note, the Lebanese drag scene aesthetic is interestingly characterized by its extravagance and grandiosity, mimicking that of Lebanese (particularly female) pop-star culture. The city’s queens find it easy to take inspiration from the region’s internationally acclaimed artists and entertainers like Elissa, Najwa Karam, Nancy Ajram, Haifa Wehbe, Nawal-El-Zoghbi and more. This reveals how much drag and extravagance is essentially part of our entertainment culture indirectly, especially since many of these artists hold the biggest LGBTQI+ fan base, as well as a style-iconography of excessively ornamented and embellished fashion and personas. Not only is it on the screens, or the radio, but also on the streets in Beirut, you can always identify a common chain of vivacious local fashion stores and designs. For example, if you go to Bourj Hammoud –one of the city’s most traditional and local shopping squares–and you take a look at one of many fashion retail stores across the area, it is quite literally a drag queen’s haven! There’s almost shimmer and glitter at every window display! All the stoned boots, the feathers, the excessively ornamented and bedazzled dresses, body and facial jewelry, makeup, nails, hair salons...etc. Lebanon has always been renounced as the “fashion capital” of the MENA region, and this status seems to have reincarnated into the new generation of Lebanese queers, who feel the need to express themselves visually –and emotionally as well, in a climate where toxic masculinity resides as the greatest threat to a more progressive and effervescent country. To carry on the legacy of Bassem Feghali, who has dedicated a long career to promote the art of Lebanese drag and be responsible for its widespread into the roots of our heteronormative entertainment industry, we need a perseverant queer youth like Beirut’s today, filled with passion, rage and love.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Interview
</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>During the interview (hyperlink) that I had personally conducted with local drag queen and activist “Sultana”, some of her most profound experiences were shared, growing up as a queer kid in a religious environment. She mentions how anti-queer and femme-phobic her friends and family has been, growing up as a feminine boy. She suffered a lot of continuous bullying and harrassment in high-school but carries on to argue how drag has helped her deal with that pressurized and accumulated agoraphobia. She explains how drag to her, is a form of liberation from her own expected gender and the hatred that is imposed upon her by the heteronormative community. In Sultana’s eyes, being a drag queen not only holds an intrapersonal feeling of fulfillment from embodying femininity, but it also hosts a pscyho-social and socio-political narrative for revolution. Sultana’s main drag inspiration comes from her own mother and grandmother. She told me a story about how when he was a little boy, he would sneak and watch his own mother spend hours trying on clothes and makeup before she would go out for family lunches or gatherings.   His grandmother as well, apparently has always been obsessed with accessories, jewels, diamonds and self-designed artisanal dresses, as well as the occasional haute couture. Sultana now performs at many local bars, it is very evident, in her drag, the influence she carries on from her mother and grandmother’s style legacy. He recycles, and restyles many of his grandmother’s old dresses and mother’s makeup in his drag performances and appearances at local bars. Having the joy to discuss some of her most personal moments on-screen, off the screen Sultana effortlessly landed every single joke she could possibly express. It was just very intriguing and entertaining for both, the videographer Tareq and I, to experience the transformation live and get appalled by the confidence she exuded when she put on that wig. We have only one thing to say I guess: “تأكّدي!¬”
