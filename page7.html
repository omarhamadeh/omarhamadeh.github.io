                <blockquote><strong>I believe I have seen the most agonizing manifestations of self-induced emptiness in the eyes of people I have encountered on the road, friends, family, and myself. This void is dark, dangerous and melancholic. It usually surfaces through the third meeting (with yourself, it surfaces around the time before you go to bed). Quite frankly, I can't help but wonder whether these emotions are psychoanalytically induced in our childhood, or are they just outcomes of postmodernism and digital addiction. In my previous work, I have mentioned a statement that quotes: "Do you love me because I remind you of the love of your mother?". But besides that, now I think that "void" is very much intrinsically charged by the specific endeavor modern telecommunications has brought upon us. We are constantly stimulated by each other's thoughts, tweets, posts, and stories. In the past, people were inhibited by each other's presence. They would find and develop ways to connect with each other; bridging personality gaps that millenials are unaware of and forgo today. These bridges are taken for granted nowadays. We expect to find them, but they are not there, even if we look for them. And that is because these bridges are not found, but built. Hence our ache. We constantly feel this profound emotional emptiness; longing for a partner or any form of closeness and affection that can fill the void of our biologically innate need for connection. However, the art of bonding is fundamentally a craft. It's an architecture, built by its designated architects. Our communication differences is what makes living so difficult but also, exciting and transformative. It is very stimulating for me to discuss things with my great grandma for example, who has completely no comprehension of Gen-Z lifestyle, fashion or values. But in this exchange, I acquire something so important to my nature as a human â€“community.</strong></blockquote>
